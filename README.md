# pythonAES/pyCryptor


### (WIP) My own Python encryption program

### encryptfiles.py (WIP):
currently can take files and encrypt them, as well as decrypt them
uses custom .pcr file type (pyCryptor is the idea...)
hashes the key using SHA256(may update to SHA512)

To-Do:
- Make more user friendly
- Make iv's not a random int from 0-98 (make an additional user input alongside the key), make it random bytes (using urandom) converted to an integer

### To-Do:

~~Convert into helper functions~~
~~Make use for string or file~~
~~Implement support for files~~
~~Combine CBC and CTR into single program and give user option~~
